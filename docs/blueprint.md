# **App Name**: Code Insights Analyzer

## Core Features:

- Code Analyzer: Analyze source code (Java or C++) to extract tokens, classify them, and detect errors using regular expressions.
- Data Visualization: Display token stream, symbol table, and lexeme statistics in a clear, tabular format.
- Enhanced Code Editor: Provide a code editor (Monaco or CodeMirror) with syntax highlighting and theming support.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Use a dark theme as default to reduce eye strain.
- Secondary color: Use a light theme for the light mode to improve readability.
- Accent: Teal (#008080) for interactive elements and key information.
- Split the main panel into two sections: code editor on the left and analysis output on the right.
- Use clear, simple icons for actions like 'Analyze', 'Reset', and language selection.
